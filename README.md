# Summation-of-Large-Integer-Numbers-using-Link-List

You will code a program that reads the numbers.txt and uses LinkList to calculate the summation of large integer numbers.

Each line in the numbers.txt is a big integer.

Each link list node can only have one digit of an integer.
As an example, you can not insert 89 as a single value, it should be inserted as 8 and 9.

You can do intermediary summations of link list values using integers (so you can keep carry value),
however, you have to insert final result values to some link list.

You can use as many link lists as you want.
